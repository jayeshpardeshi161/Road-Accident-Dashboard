## 🔑 Key Findings
Majority of accidents occur under fine weather but also involve serious casualties during rainy/snowy conditions.

Cars and Motorcycles account for the largest share of casualties.

Urban roads have higher accident frequency, while rural roads show higher severity (fatal/serious).

YoY comparisons reveal a decrease/increase in certain accident types depending on the year (requires dynamic parameter input).

________________________________________

## 💼 Business Impact

Helps transport departments and policy-makers understand risk factors.

Supports urban planning with hotspot detection.

Enables insurance providers to assess location-based risks.

Encourages public awareness via open dashboards or government data portals.

________________________________________

## 🔍 Insights & Inference

Environmental factors (weather & road surface) significantly influence accident severity.

Real-time, parameterized dashboards provide data democratization.

Severity-based filtering helps targeted interventions.

## ✅ Conclusion

The Road Accident Dashboard is a powerful tool for analyzing historical accident trends and drawing attention to key risk areas. With dynamic filters, grouped categories, and YoY comparisons, it can serve multiple stakeholders from analysts to policymakers in building safer roads.

### 📈 KPI Design & Implementation
Created KPI cards using calculated fields to track Total Accidents (144,419), Casualties (195,737), and Severity metrics, with embedded YoY percentage changes.

Applied filter logic to ensure all KPI and chart components responded dynamically to accident severity parameter, ensuring consistency across visualizations.

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Cleaned and transformed a 66,000+ row dataset; handled null values, outliers (geo-coordinates), and converted dates for temporal analysis.

Derived key analytical dimensions such as weather condition, road surface, and road type, resulting in accurate segmentation (e.g., 80.7% of accidents in fine weather, 67.4% on dry roads).

### 🗺️ Geospatial & Contextual Insights
Mapped all casualties by latitude/longitude using Mapbox in Tableau, enabling hotspot detection across UK regions for policy and urban planning.

Exposed geographic risk zones and supported stakeholders (e.g., transport departments) with actionable insights into accident-prone areas.

### 🛠️ Business Impact & Outcomes
Enabled data-driven decision-making by visualizing the role of environmental and vehicle factors in accident severity.

Supported public safety and insurance strategy with insights on urban vs rural road risks, contributing to more focused interventions and planning.
